# THE WALL STREET INVESTOR

On Monday, May 28, 1962, prices of the New York Stock Exchange crumbled rapidly before an avalanche of sell orders. The Dow-Jones industrial average plunged nearly 35 points to register its biggest one-day drop in over 32 years. Crashing through the 600 level for the first time since 1960, it hit a day's low of 576.93.

By the end of the day, many big-board stocks were selling at prices from 30 to 80 percent below their 1962 highs. Shares traded on the American Exchange and over-the-counter markets followed suit and also went into nosedives. Headline writers were quick to respond to the developments being reported by the lagging ticker:

BLACK MONDAY PANIC ON WALL STREET INVESTORS LOSE BILLIONS AS MARKET BREAKS NATION FEARS NEW 1929 DEBACLE

Such were the scare heads that appeared on the front pages of the nation's newspapers after the New York Stock Exchange closed for the day. By the time later editions came off the press, experts and analysts, economists and pundits were offering their explanations, hindsight diagnoses and spur-of-the-moment prognostications. As is often the case in such situations, some of the secondguessers and crystal-ball gazers tried to gloss over the implications of the collapse, while others appeared to take an almost sadistic delight in prophesying even worse things to come.

Two days later, several newspapers and wire-service correspondents descended on me. They wanted to know my opinions and reactions and asked what I was doing because of the break in stock prices. I told them quite frankly that, while I sympathized wholeheartedly with anyone who had lost money because of market developments, I saw little if any reason for alarm and absolutely none for panic.

The over-all current business picture was favorable and, what was even more important, gave promise of getting better in the future. There was nothing basically wrong with the American economy nor the vast majority of companies whose stocks were listed on the New York Stock Exchange. In my view, some stocks had been grossly overpriced. Irrational buying had driven their prices to totally unrealistic levels. The May 28 break was an inevitable consequence.

I said that I felt the stock market was in a much healthier and certainly in a much more realistic position because of the long-needed adjustment of prices. As for what I was doing, the answer was simple. I was buying stocks.

"I'd be foolish not to buy," I explained to a young correspondent who looked as though he thought I'd taken leave of my senses by buying when everyone else seemed to be selling. "Most seasoned investors are doubtless doing much the same thing," I went on, feeling somewhat like a schoolmaster conducting a short course in the First Principles of Investment. "They're snapping up the fine stock bargains available as a result of the emotionally inspired selling wave."

Since the petroleum industry is the one I know best, I bought oil stocks. By the end of the New York Stock Exchange trading day on May 29, my brokers had purchased several tens of thousands of shares for my account. I hasten to emphasize that I bought the stocks for investment and not for speculation. I fully intend holding on to them, for I believe they will continue to increase in value over the years to come.

It has long been the custom for journalists and financial writers to interview successful businessmen and investors whenever there is an "unusual" stock market development. The opinions, information and advice gathered from these sources are then published, ostensibly for the guidance of less sophisticated investors. For as long as I can remember, veteran businessmen and investors—I among them—have been warning about the dangers of irrational stock speculation and hammering away at the theme that stock certificates are deeds of ownership in business enterprises and not betting slips.

Get-rich-quick schemes just don't work. If they did, then everyone on the face of the earth would be a millionaire. This holds as true for stock market dealings as it does for any other form of business activity.

Don't misunderstand me. It is possible to make moneyand a great deal of money—in the stock market. But it can't be done overnight or by haphazard buying and selling. The big profits go to the intelligent, careful and patient investor, not to the reckless and overeager speculator. Conversely, it is the speculator who suffers the losses when the market takes a sudden downturn. The seasoned investor buys his stocks when they are priced low, holds them for the long-pull rise and takes in-between dips and slumps in his stride.

"Buy when stock prices are low—the lower the betterand hold onto your securities," a highly successful financier advised me years ago, when I first started buying stocks. "Bank on the trends and don't worry about the tremors. Keep your mind on the long-term cycles and ignore the sporadic ups and downs . . . "

Great numbers of people who purchase stocks seem unable to grasp these simple principles. They do not buy when prices are low. They are fearful of bargains. They wait until a stock goes by—and up—and then buy because they feel they are thus getting in on a sure thing. Very often, they buy too late— just before a stock has reached one of its peaks. Then they get caught and suffer losses when the price breaks even a few points.

Typical of these people is an acquaintance of mine with whom I had lunch one day in 1955. We talked about many things—including the stock market. During the course of the conversation I happened to mention that the X

Corporations shares were selling at 4 ½, and that I thought the stock would go up in price.

By late 1957, the stock stood at 11 I later learned that my acquaintance had kept his eye on the stock for two years and, when it reached 11 1/4, he finally decided it was safe to buy and purchased several hundred shares. He watched happily while the stock climbed to 13 ½ in the next six months. Then there was a dip. X shares fell to 10 and stayed there. My Johnny-come-lately acquaintance sold out and lost money. Those of us who'd bought early held on, for the securities were worth more than twice what we had paid for them.

Eventually, the stock rose again, going up several more points to reach another fairly steady price plateau. Today, it's around 15—and those of us who bought early are holding on to it firmly. I might add that we've also collected satisfactory dividends on the stock through the years.

I began buying common stocks at the depths of the Depression. Prices were at their lowest, and there weren't many stock buyers around. Most people with money to invest were unable to see the forest of potential profit for the multitudinous trees of their largely baseless fears. I had confidence in the future of the American economy and realized that the shares of many entirely sound companies with fine potentials were selling at only a fraction of their true worth.

When I first bought Tide Water Associated Oil Company stock in 1932, its price was as low as $2.12 per share. The average per-share open-market price of the stock rose steadily, as shown below:

The price fell off during the 1938 slump, but this was just one of the sporadic tremors. I not only held on to the shares I owned, but bought more.

My confidence was fully justified in the years that followed as the value of the stock increased many, many times, and I— along with all the other stockholders—also collected handsome dividends.

In May 1932, I also started purchasing Petroleum Corporation stock. In that month, I bought 10,000 shares at $3.45 per share. I continued to buy steadily until, by September 14 1933, I held a total of 190,000 shares. In that month, the shares were worth nearly $15 each; the average per-share cost of my 190,000 shares was only $6.537.

I have reached back to the Depression era for two examples based on my own experiences. I could cite others from that period and from subsequent ones. Some stocks I own today are worth more than 100 times what I originally paid for them. But many other investors have had even greater successes. More examples would serve only to further underscore the same basic truth, one that every investor and would-be investor would do well to paste in his hat:

Sound stocks, purchased for investment when their prices are low and held for the long

pull, are very likely to produce high profits through dividends and increases in value.

This is a self-evident "secret" of successful investment that vast numbers of people disregard. There are other notso-secret secrets that investors would do well to learn and consider as inflexible rules in their stock market dealings.

Highly important among them is the axiom that no one should ever buy a stock without knowing as much as possible about the company that issues it. In more cases than legitimate brokers would care to count, such so-called investors have insisted on buying large numbers of shares in companies without having the foggiest notion of what those companies do or produce.

As I see it, the average person should consider the purchase of common stock as the investment of surplus capital for the purpose of earning an annual return on that capital and of eventually increasing the capital as much as possible.

The average individual begins "investing" by opening a savings account or by buying insurance or annuities. He usually graduates to buying Government bonds. Later, when he is more experienced and sure of himself, he may decide to invest in common stocks. If and when he does so, he should follow certain definite rules for his own protection and benefit.

In the main, the average investor should consider buying only such common stocks as are listed on a major stock exchange. There are many good reasons for this. Some unlisted stocks are worthless, bogus shares peddled by fly-by-night companies. Even when the unlisted stocks are legitimate the buyer often finds that he is "locked in"

with his investment; it is frequently difficult to sell an unlisted security.

The person who buys or sells listed stocks can always be certain he is paying—or receiving—a price that is fair and bona fide to the extent that it has been set by buyers and sellers according to the law of supply and demand in a free market place. The same cannot always be said for unlisted stocks, which may be pegged at artificially high prices or, in some cases, have no value at all.

Common stocks should be purchased when their prices are low, not after they have risen to high levels during an upward bull-market spiral. Buy when everyone else is selling and hold on until everyone else is buying—this is more than just a catchy slogan. It is the very essence of successful investment.

History shows that the overall trend of stock priceslike the overall trend of living costs, wages and almost everything else—is up. Naturally there have been and always will be dips, slumps, recessions and even depressions, but these are invariably followed by recoveries which carry most stock prices to new highs. Assuming that a stock and the company behind it are sound, an investor can hardly lose if he buys shares at the bottom and holds them until the inevitable upward cycle gets well under way.

Withal, the wise investor realizes that it is no longer possible to consider the stock market as a whole. Today's stock market is far too vast and complex for anyone to make sweeping generalized predictions about the course the market as such will follow.

It is necessary to view the present-day stock market in terms of groups of stocks, but it is not enough merely to classify them as, say, industrials or aircrafts, and so on. This is an era of constant and revolutionary scientific and

technological changes and advances. Not only individual firms, but also entire industries must be judged as to their ability to keep pace with the needs of the future. The investor has to be certain that neither the products of the company in which he invests nor the particular industry itself will become obsolete in a few years.

In the early part of the century, farsighted individuals realized that automobiles had more of a future than buckboards, that automobile-tire manufacturers' stocks were better investment bets than the stocks of firms that manufactured wagon wheels.

The trolley-car industry was a good bet—until trolley cars began to be supplanted by buses. Airplane makers who insisted on producing nothing but canvas-covered planes after the day of the all-metal airplane dawned had little future. Today, the manufacturer of jet or turboprop transport planes is much more likely to be in business and make money than one, say, who insisted on turning out trimotored, piston-engined transports.

It is indeed surprising that so many investors fail to recognize business situations only slightly less obvious than these dated or farfetched examples. They will buy stocks in faltering or dying firms and industries and ignore tempting opportunities to buy into companies and industries that cannot help but burgeon as time goes on.

It follows that the investor must know as much as he possibly can about the corporation in which he buys stock. The following are some of the questions for which he should get satisfactory answers before he invests his money:

1. What is the company's history: Is it a solid and reputable firm, and does it have able, efficient and seasoned management?

2. Is the company producing or dealing in goods or services for which there will be a continuing demand in the foreseeable future?

3. Is the company in a field that is not dangerously overcrowded, and is it in a good competitive position?

4. Are company policies and operations farsighted and aggressive without calling for unjustified and dangerous over-expansion?

5. Will the corporate balance sheet stand up under the close scrutiny of a critical and impartial auditor?

6. Does the corporation have a satisfactory earnings record?

7. Have reasonable dividends been paid regularly to stockholders? If dividend payments were missed, were there good and sufficient reasons?

8. Is the company well within safe limits insofar as both long- and short-term borrowing are concerned?

9. Has the price of the stock moved up and down over the past few years without violently wide and apparently inexplicable fluctuations?

10. Does the per-share value of the company's net realizable assets exceed the stock exchange value of a common stock share at the time the investor contemplates buying?

Many stock buyers have failed to ask these questions. In some cases, they bought the stocks of companies that had not shown a profit for some time. But the issues would "get hot," as speculators are wont to say, and multiply several times over their issue price within a matter of weeks or even days. Then, someone would realize that the heat was being generated solely by irrational buying—and the prices would plummet.

I repeat that I personally believe that selected—and I want again to emphasize the word selected—common

stocks are excellent investments. There are innumerable fine buys on the market today. Among them are many stocks issued by companies with net realizable assets two, three, four and even more times greater than the stock exchange value of their issued shares.

What does this mean to the investor? Well, for example, let's suppose that the mythical XYZ Corporation has realizable assets with a net value of $20,000,000. At the same time, it has 1,000,000 shares of common stock outstanding and the stock is selling at $10 per share. The arithmetic is simple. The $20,000,000 net value of the company's realizable assets is double the total $10,000,000 value of its outstanding common shares. Thus, anyone buying a share of the XYZ Corporation's common stock at $10 is buying $20 worth of actual, hard assets.

Such situations are not nearly so unusual as one might imagine—and the shrewd, seasoned investor takes the time and trouble to seek them out. Occasionally—though admittedly such instances are rare—especially astute investors discover companies that have undistributed surpluses equal to a sizable percentage of the market value of the outstanding common stock. Anyone buying stock in such a company is actually buying an amount of money equal to a goodly portion of his investment, as well as a share in the corporation's other assets.

I might point out, however, that the exact opposite may be true, and that the investor will still be safe. An individual does not necessarily have to buy stocks in a company whose vaults are bulging with cash in order to make a sound investment. There are many times when an entirely healthy company will be very short of cash.

Another valuable investment secret is that the owners of sound securities should never panic and unload their

holdings when prices skid. Countless individuals have panicked during slumps, selling out when their stocks fell a few points, only to find that before long the prices were once more rising.

The professional or experienced semiprofessional investor has little in common with speculators who hopefully play the market when prices are spiraling up. The veteran investor objectively looks for bargains in growth stocks—which he buys and holds, and from which he generally reaps handsome profits over a period of years. He banks on the climate—and makes all necessary allowances and takes all precautions so that he can ride out any stock market storms.

There is still a lingering misconception that the small or amateur investor is at the mercy of the big investors and the Wall Street financiers. This might have been the case in the dim, distant and unlamented days of Jay Gould, but nothing could be further from the truth today. No ruthless, rapacious Wall Street tycoon can rig the market or corner the stocks of an entire industry these days. For one thing, stock market transactions are closely regulated by such highly efficient and potent watchdog organizations and agencies as the Federal Securities and Exchange Commission—the SEC. For another, the common stocks of most large corporations are owned by thousands and tens of thousands of individuals, organizations, mutual fund groups and so on. "Big" investors seldom own more than a comparatively small percentage of a large corporation's common stock.

If anything, it is the professional investor who is at the mercy of the speculator and the amateur—at least in the sense that the latter categories of stock buyers and sellers set the pattern for the market.

The professional investor purchases stocks on what might be termed a scientific, or at least a cerebral, basis. He analyzes facts and figures objectively and with great care and does his buying for purposes of long-term investment. He is, in effect, banking that the stocks he buys will increase appreciably in value over the next few or several years.

It is the emotional nonprofessional investor who sends the price of a stock up or down in sharp, sporadic and more or less short-lived spurts. A politician's speech, an ivory-tower pundit's pronouncements or prophecies, a newspaper item or a whispered rumor—such things are enough to trigger wildly enthusiastic buying sprees or hysterical orgies of panicky selling by thousands of self-styled investors. The professional investor has no choice but to sit by quietly while the mob has its day, until the enthusiasm or the panic of the speculators and nonprofessionals have been spent.

The seasoned investor does not allow temporary fluctuations in stock-market prices to influence his decisions to any great extent. Usually, he waits until prices return to approximately the levels at which he wants to buy or sell. He is not impatient, nor is he even in a very great hurry, for he is an investor—not a gambler nor a speculator.

People often ask me what specific advice I would give to individuals who have various amounts—$1000, $10,000, $100,000 or even more—to invest in common stocks. My answers are always the same. Whether I had $100 or $1,000,-000 to invest, I would consider buying only such common stocks as are listed on a major stock exchange. I would apply the rules and tests I've enumerated and select the soundest and most promising growth stocks. And, I might add, I would certainly ignore the advice of promoters

and theorists who peddle harebrained formulas or "secret" methods for making huge and quick profits on the stock market. There has been a spate of How to Get Rich Overnight books in recent years. Seasoned financiers and investors laugh at them—or rather, they feel only pity for the gullible individuals who follow the "advice" contained in such tomes. The May 1962 Wall Street collapse pulled down many of these "blinkered" speculators, so its history should be worth examining.

In order to achieve any understanding of that collapse, it is helpful to first quickly trace the course of the market over the preceding 12 years. The easiest way to do this is by following the Dow-Jones industrial average.

At the 1950 low, the Dow-Jones industrial average stood at 161.60. It climbed to 293.79 by the end of 1952, dropped to 255.49 in mid-1953, then climbed steadily to 521.04 in 1956, from which level it drifted down to around 420 at the end of 1957.

From 420 in 1957, the Dow-Jones average rose to well over 650 in 1959, made some up-and-down zigzags and hit a late-1960 low of 566.05. From that base, it shot up to a then all-time peak of 734.91 on December 13, 1961.

As the market moved upward through 1961, some Wall Street veterans dusted off the oft-quoted pre-1929 crash saying that the stock market was discounting not only the future, but the hereafter as well.

Many years ago, the per-share price vs. per-share earnings ratio was widely—though unofficially—adopted as a reliable rule-of-thumb indicator of stock values. "Ten times earnings" was long considered the maximum permissible price one could pay for a stock and still reasonably expect to make a profit.

Then, in the late 1920s, GM-Du Pont's John J. Raskobwhose outlook was judged quite bullish—ventured the opinion that certain stocks might be worth as much as 15 times their per-share earnings. After the 1929 crash, ratios were, of course, very much lower and, even as late as 1950, the price-earnings ratios of the stocks listed in the Dow-Jones industrial index averaged out to about 6:1.

Views on the price-earnings ratio underwent considerable revision in recent years. Some knowledgeable investors allowed that in a rapidly burgeoning economy, stocks of especially healthy companies might reasonably sell for as much as 20 times their per-share earnings. Other professional investors argued persuasively that when healthy companies had tangible assets with net, per-share replacement or liquidation values in excess of per-share prices, the importance of the price-earnings ratio would logically dwindle.

But few seasoned investors approved such situations as developed in 1960-1962, when frenzied buying drove prices so high that some issues were selling for more than 100 times their per-share earnings. In more than a few instances during the 1960-1962 period, staggering prices were paid for the stocks of companies that had only negligible assets, questionable potentials—and that hadn't shown much in the way of profits for a considerable time.

It has been suggested that the boom that began in 1960 was caused by people buying stocks as a hedge against inflation. If this is true, the insane inflation of certain common-stock prices was an extremely odd way to go about it. But the hedge theory appears even less valid when one remembers that buyers consistently ignored many fine stocks that, by any standards of measurement, were underpriced and concentrated on certain issues,

continuing to buy them after their prices had soared out of sight. All evidence inclines the observer to believe that the great mass of non-professional buyers was obeying a sort of herd instinct, following the crowd to snap up the popular issues without much regard for facts. Many people were doing their investment thinking—if it can properly be called that—with their emotions rather than with their heads. They looked for lightning-fast growth in stocks that were already priced higher than the limits of any genuine value levels to which they could conceivably grow in the foreseeable future.

It is an old Wall Street saw that the stock market will always find a reason for whatever it does—after having done it. Innumerable theories have been advanced to explain why the market broke on May 28, 1962. The blame has been placed on everything from "selling waves by foreign speculators" to the Kennedy Administration's reaction to the aborted steel industry price increase—in fact, on everything but the most obvious reasons.

The factors that bring on financial panics are many and varied. For example, in 1869, the cause was an attempted corner on gold. In 1873 and 1907, bank failures started the trouble. In 1929, the stock market was vastly overpriced, and the general state of American business and the rate of America's economic expansion were such as to justify little or none of the stock buying that carried prices to the towering peaks from which they inevitably had to fall.

Despite all the efforts that have been expended to draw a close parallel between the 1929 crash and the 1962 price break, the two have practically nothing in common.

True, some segments of the stock market were grossly overpriced in 1960-1962; far too many stocks were priced

far too high. But the nation's business outlook was generally good in 1962, and the economy was expanding at a merry clip. There were no hidden, deep-down structural flaws in the economy such as there had been in 1929.

There were other great differences. In 1929, stock speculation was done mainly on borrowed money; shares were purchased on the most slender of margins. Thus, when prices collapsed, credit collapsed, too.

Then, of course, there is the most important difference of all, the one the calamity howlers conveniently forgot. May 28, 1962, was not a crash. It was an adjustment—albeit a somewhat violent one.

As I've said, some stocks were selling for more than 100 times their earnings during the height of the 1960-1962 boom. Now, it would be rather difficult for a company to expand enough to justify stock prices that were 100 times the company's per-share earnings. Even assuming that every penny of the company's earnings were paid out in dividends to common-stockholders, the stockholders would still be receiving only a one-percent return on their investment. But if all earnings were distributed in dividends, there would be no money left for the company to spend on expansion. That, of course, would effectively eliminate any possibility of capital growth. Yet, even with these glaringly self-evident truths staring them in the face, people bought overpriced stocks.

Such were the difficult situations that developed—and that caused the stock market to fall. Experienced investors should have been able to read the warning signals loud and clear long before the May 28 break took place.

As I stated previously, the Dow-Jones industrial average shot to its all-time high of 734.91 on December 13, 1961.

The downward movement began immediately afterward and continued through December 1961 and January 1962. There was a brief recovery that continued until March, when the Dow-Jones average edged up over 720, but the graph line shows the recovery was an uncertain, faltering one. The downward trend was resumed in March—and the graph line from then on makes a steep descent that is broken by only a few spasmodic upward jogs.

The May 28, 1962, price break had its beginnings in December 1961. The downward adjustment was evidently needed and unavoidable. That it culminated in the sharp price plunge of May 28 was due to the emotional reactionverging on panic—shown by inexperienced investors who were unable to realize that what was happening had to happen and, what was worse, who understood almost nothing of what was going on around them. To paraphrase Abraham Lincoln, all stock market investors cannot fool themselves all of the time. The awakening had to comeand it did.

The anatomy of a stock market boom-and-bust such as the country experienced in 1962 is not too difficult to analyze. The seeds of any bust are inherent in any boom that outstrips the pace of whatever solid factors gave it its impetus in the first place.

An old and rather corny comedy line has it that the only part of an automobile that cannot be made foolproof by a safety device is the nut that holds the wheel. By much the same token, there are no safeguards that can protect the emotional investor from himself.

Having bid the market up irrationally, these emotional investors became terrified and unloaded their holdings just as irrationally. Unfortunately, an emotionally inspired selling wave snowballs and carries with it the prices of all

issues, even those that should be going up rather than down.

Withal, I believe it is absolutely essential for the American public to bear in mind that:

1. The nation's economy was relatively sound on Friday afternoon, May 25, 1962, when the New York Stock Exchange closed for the weekend.

2. The U.S. economy was just as sound on the following Monday morning, when the stock exchange reopened.

3. The economy was basically no less sound when trading ended on that hectic Monday. Few—if anyindustrial orders were canceled. Few—if any—jobs were lost. Few—if any— business establishments were forced to close their doors. Few —if any—investors, large or small, were completely wiped out as so many had been in 1929.

I realize that all this is scant comfort to those who lost money when stock prices fell on May 28. It can only be hoped that they will profit from the painful lesson.

The wise investor will recognize that many stocks being offered on the market are still considerably underpriced. For example, there are many issues selling for as little as one-third or even one-fourth the net, per-share liquidation values of the issuing company's assets. To understand what this can mean to the stockholder, consider the case of the Honolulu Oil Company.

A few years ago, the directors and stockholders of the Honolulu Oil Company decided for reasons of their own to dissolve the company. One company in which I hold a substantial interest and another oil company learned of this decision and together signified their desire to buy Honolulu Oil's assets.

The stockholders of Honolulu Oil had their choice of two ways in which they could sell their company's assets. First,

they could sell their stock to the two buying companies. Or, alternatively, they could hold their stock, sell the actual assets and distribute the proceeds among themselves before formally dissolving their company.

Honolulu Oil's shareholders chose the latter method. The company's stock was selling at around $30 per sharebut, so valuable were its tangible assets, that the price the buying companies paid for them worked out to about $100 per share. This, of course, was the sum each Honolulu stockholder received for each share he held when the company was dissolved. In other words, the cash value of Honolulu Oil's assets was more than three times as much as the total value of its issued stock.

Naturally, shareholders can reap this particular type of windfall profit only when the company concerned is dissolved. But it should be plain to see how much added safety there is in investing in a company that has tangible assets with a net liquidation value greater than the value of its stock. If, as an example, the net liquidation value is three times that of the stock, then, in effect, each dollar of the stockholder's investment is secured by three dollars' worth of realizable assets.

There are more such companies than one might imagine. They can be found in various industries, but I am most familiar with companies in the petroleum industry and, more particularly, with those engaged in the business of producing oil.

Several oil stocks issued by sound, thriving companies are selling at prices well within any reasonable priceearnings ratio limits. Some of these oil companies also have tangible assets worth three, four and even more times the total value of their issued stock. It might be of interest to consider just one reason why this is so. Producing oil

companies normally carry their oil and gas leases at cost on their balance sheets. A lease for which a company paid, say, $25,000 is carried at that figure even though it covers a property on which the proven crude-oil reserves in place are, as is entirely possible, 50,000,000 barrels. On the books, the lease is shown as an asset worth $25,000, even though any other producing oil company would gladly pay several million dollars to take it over. The implications of this bit of accounting intelligence will not be lost on the alert investor. Similar situations exist in many other industries, and the astute investor will find them and profit from them.

My own confidence in the stock market has not been shaken by the May 28 price break nor by later drops. I am still a heavy investor in common stocks. I'm still bankingto the tune of many millions of dollars—on the healthy climate of the American economy and the bright future of American business.

This, in essence, is the only advice and counsel a successful, experienced investor can give to anyone who wishes to reap the benefits of a boom and to avoid the losses of a bust.
