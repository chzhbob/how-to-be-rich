# PREFACE

In 1960, the editors of playboy magazine approached me with a request that I prepare a series of articles based on the theme: "Men, Money and Values in Today's Society."

Admittedly, I found the proposal flattering—as who would not? On the other hand, I seriously questioned my qualifications for the task. My entire adult life had been devoted to building and operating business enterprises. I doubted that this experience equipped me to hold forth on a variety of subjects before an audience of millions.

Besides, I was—and, for that matter, still am—active in business. I was far from certain that I would have the time necessary to write. Finally, I wasn't at all convinced that the magazine's readers would be very interested in what I had to say.

But my doubts and reservations were overcome by what, to me, seemed valid and convincing considerations and arguments.

First of all, I had long been aware that American business and businessmen and the entire free-enterprise system were very often the targets of severe criticism—and even abuse. Few, indeed, were the reasoned replies and rebuttals which reached the eyes and ears of the general public.

Then, as I—and so many other successful businessmen of my acquaintance—have so frequently noted, many young people today enter upon business careers without sufficient grounding and preparation. By this, I do not mean that they lack specialized training. Rather, it is that they fail to

grasp the over-all, the long-range picture. They do not understand and appreciate the universally applicable fundamentals, the basic philosophies, the endless implications and ramifications —and particularly the numberless responsibilities—which are the absolute essentials of business in this complex age.

Also—and this was far from the least of the considerations which decided me—I felt that, in our contemporary society, far too much emphasis was being placed on getting rich, on amassing wealth. Little if any attention was being paid to the very important question of how to be rich, how to discharge the responsibilities created by wealth even while constructively enjoying the privileges and prerogatives conferred by it.

After all, "richness" is at least as much a matter of character, of philosophy, outlook and attitude, as it is of money. The "millionaire mentality" is not—and in this day and age, cannot be—merely an accumulative mentality. The able, ambitious man who strives for success must understand that the term "rich" has infinite shadings of meaning. In order to justify himself and his wealth, he must know how to he rich in virtually every positive sense of the term.

These factors—and some others—all contributed to my final decision to accede to the editors' request.

I might add that PLAYBOY'S Editor-Publisher, Hugh M. Hefner, and the magazine's Editorial Director, A. C. Spectorsky, promised that I would be granted carte blanche to say what I wanted, regardless of how unconventional, nonconformist or controversial my views happened to be. They have kept this promise faithfully through the ensuing years —but I am getting ahead of myself.

"I will prepare the first piece, and then we'll see," I said, in effect.

The results, to say the least, were surprising to me. Although what I have written is unconventional, even iconoclastic, the response has been overwhelmingly favorable. Evidently, many people shared my views or had been waiting for someone to express opinions confirming their own deep-seated doubts and unease about widely accepted doctrines and theories.

It has been a source of immeasurable satisfaction that my writing for PLAYBOY has been well received, widely quoted and has inspired thousands of favorable comments and letters from press and public. This book is the result of that reception.

In the years that have intervened since the first article was published, I have often been asked three questionsquestions I would like to answer here as simply and directly as possible.

1. Why, considering the large number of magazines being published in America today, did I choose PLAYBOY as the medium through which to express my views?

The answer is, indeed, simple, PLAYBOY enjoys a very high readership among young executives and college students. These are the individuals who will be the businessmen and business leaders of the future. These are precisely the individuals who would be likely to benefit from any information I might impart as a result of my own experience in the business world. These are the young men, and women, whose thinking processes can—and should—be prodded by ideas and opinions not necessarily contained in textbooks or staid, over-conservative publications. Whether they accept or reject the ideas is immaterial; they are able to think, and they do think constructively as a result of mental stimuli. They are, in short, the individuals to whom I want to address any "message" I can offer.

2. Why did I want to express my views in the first place?

I have already touched on this, but I feel that some amplification might be in order. I've said that although business is often attacked publicly, it does not very often find many public defenders. The average businessman generally speaks before board or stockholders' meetings or at trade-association, Chamber of Commerce or service-club luncheons and dinners. When he writes, it is usually for house organs or trade journals. Although he has a very vital and important message for the public at large, he seldom receives, or takes, the opportunity to deliver it. Simply stated, I have tried to start the ball rolling —and I hope that I may have encouraged other successful businessmen to air their views before the general public.

3. What do I hope to achieve by my writing?

Beyond what I have already mentioned, I have several hopes and aims. I would like to convince young businessmen that there are no sure-fire, quick-and-easy formulas for success in business, that there are no ways in which a man can automatically become a millionaire in business.

There are no tricks, no magical incantations or sorcerer's potions which can make a business or a businessman an overnight success. Many qualities and much hard work are needed, as are innumerable other elements, before a businessman or woman can achieve success and reach the millionaire level. The various qualities, elements and factors which other successful businessmen and I have found to be essential or helpful are subjects of this book.

I am firmly convinced that the future of American business, of the American people—and, indeed, of the entire free world —lies in the perpetuation of a progressive,

farsighted free-enterprise system guided by progressive, farsighted businessmen who will reap their rewards from improving the living standards of all. If, by writing this book, I have passed this message on—even if only to a receptive few—then I shall have achieved my purpose and received a very rich reward in the form of personal gratification from the thought that I have in some small measure helped spread and strengthen the principles in which I believe.
